title: Which version(s) of Ember are in use in your apps?
question-id: MS_Q401
fragment: MS_Q401

We asked this question for ember.js, ember-cli, and ember-data. However, we chose not to include the results here for ember-cli as the data suggested similar trends between the responses for ember.js and ember-cli. During the course of the survey, Ember 3.8 became the latest stable release of the framework. Despite the nature of the changes being released for the Octane edition of Ember, 28% of developers reported working with Ember 3.7, and 12.5% reported working with 3.8 (only released a few weeks ago). Ember 1.13 usage continues to drop, and this year only 4% of developers report working with a 1.13 app.
