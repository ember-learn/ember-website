    New to building websites, or just want a more in-depth introduction to Ember? The tutorial is for you!

intro:

    Build with the teams that never stop shipping.
  sub1: |
    Some of the best development teams in the world have been iterating on their products for
    years with Ember. With scalable UI architecture baked-in from the start, you'll be working
    with the same patterns these organizations use every step of the way.
  sub2: |
    It's time to start building from the 20th floor.

batteries:
  title: Batteries are included
  sub: |
    Ember’s out-of-the-box experience has everything you need to start building on day one and
    keep shipping for years. Benefit from our years of experience to help your team be
    productive—faster. You'll never have to wire together your own framework ever again!

  build:
    title: Build pipeline
    sub: |
      Ember CLI is the backbone of modern Ember apps, providing code generators to
      create new entities and putting the necessary files in the right place, every time.
      Ember apps come with a <strong>built-in development environment</strong> with fast rebuilds,
      auto-reload, and a test runner! <br><br> Ready to deploy? That's easy, too!
      build your app for production with a single command.

routing:
  title: Routing
  sub: |
    The URL has always been one of the major strengths of the web, and Ember apps respect that.
    Ember's built-in router is a <strong>best-in-class solution</strong> that incorporates
    async data loading with dynamic url segments and query parameters.
    The Ember router seamlessly supports nested urls with incremental data fetching,
    nested loading, and error substates.

data-layer:
  title: Data layer
  sub: |
    While you can use any data layer for your app, every new Ember app includes a fully-featured
    data access library called <a href="https://guides.emberjs.com/release/models/">Ember Data</a>.
    <br><br>Ember Data allows you to access data across multiple sources at once,
    setup asynchronous relationships, and keep models up-to-date across your app.

testing:
  title: Testing
  sub: |
    Enjoy a fully-featured, modern test harness built into every application by default.
    Every time an entity is generated in an Ember app, tests are also generated for that same entity.
    Ember apps support three levels of testing that are handy for testing everything from
    individual components to acceptance tests that can boot your whole app and interact with it
    to verify everything is working as it should be. <br><br>Tests are also run in the browser,
    providing that extra peace of mind.

performance:
  title: Performance
  sub: |
    Ember is built on the Glimmer rendering engine, one of the fastest rendering technologies on
    the market today, thanks to the way it compiles templates down to a highly-performant
    virtual machine. <br><br>Due to our holistic performance approach, <strong>performance
    upgrades are often free</strong> with version upgrades— no extra work necessary!

upgrades:
  title: Easy upgrades
  sub: |
    Ember follows a 6-week release cycle, releasing a new minor version every 6 weeks.
    With a <strong>strong commitment to stability</strong>, upgrades between minor versions are
    straightforward and fast. The well-thought-out deprecation mechanism that gives you ample
    warning of code that would need to change in the next major version, and deprecated or
    upgraded features often come with codemods that can be run to automatically update your
    codebase. <br><br>If you do happen to get stuck, our friendly community is ready and willing to help!

ecosystem:
  title: The Ember Ecosystem

    There's never been a better time to be a JavaScript developer,
    and Ember embraces everything that modern JS has to offer.
    When you're ready for more, choose from hundreds of high-quality,
    curated community Ember Addons to super-power your application.
  js:
    title: Use the modern JavaScript you know and love
    sub: |
      ES6 classes, fat arrow functions, even decorators-
      it's easy to use the latest and greatest JavaScript features in your app,
      zero configuration required. Love Typescript? We've got great support for that too!
      And tools like Prettier pair perfectly with your Ember app's JavaScript code.
  addons:
    title: |
      Meet Addons: high-quality, curated npm packages that supercharge your app
    sub: |
      <p>
        While Ember CLI makes it easy to add any third-party node module,
        Ember Addons provide capabilities that go way beyond your typical npm package.
      </p>
      <p>
        By hooking into Ember CLI's standardized tooling,
        Addons can modify your app's build steps, help you out with deployment,
        inline images and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        With all this power wrapped up into a single install command,
        and no additional build tool or configuration required,
        you'll wonder how you could ever go back to wiring up dependencies on your own again.

        about which one's better?
      </p>
      <p>
        With <a href="https://emberobserver.com">Ember Observer</a>,
        you'll never have to assess the quality of your project's dependencies on your own.

        Metrics like great documentation,
        recent releases and automated tests across multiple Ember versions mean you can be
