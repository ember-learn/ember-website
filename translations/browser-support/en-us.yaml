  heading: "Ember 3.0.0"
  support: |
    Ember currently targets Internet Explorer 11 as a baseline for support.
    This means that generally all modern and relatively recent browsers will work with Ember,
    since browsers are backwards compatible by design.
    Ember runs tests against the latest desktop versions of the following browsers:

    In Ember 4.0.0, the framework will support the following major browsers:
  other-browsers: |
      Other browsers may work with Ember.js, but are not explicitly supported.
      If you would like to add support for a new browser, please
      <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs">submit an RFC or RFC issue for discussion</a>!
  evergreen:
    support: |
      We determine support on a browser-by-browser basis.
      Browsers are categorized as either <em>evergreen</em> or <em>non-evergreen</em>.
      The categorization is as follows:
    sub-heading: Evergreen
  non-evergreen:
    sub-heading: Non-evergreen

  formula:
    intro: |
      For evergreen browsers, the minimum version of the browser that we support is
      determined at the time of every minor release, following this formula:
    query: |
      Whichever browser version is greater/more recent out of:
    properties: |
      <ol>
        <li>
          The lowest/least recent version that fulfills any one of these properties:
          <ul>
            <li>It is the latest version of the browser.</li>
            <li>It is the latest LTS/extended support version of the browser (such as Firefox ESR).</li>
            <li>It has at least <em>0.25%</em> of global marketshare usage across mobile and
          desktop, based on <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/">statcounter</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The minimum version supported in the previous release
        </li>
      </ol>
    p1: |
      To simplify, the supported version either moves forward or stays the same for
      each release based on overall usage and LTS/current release versions.
    p2: |
      For non-evergreen browsers, support is locked at a specific major version, and
      we support all major versions above that version:




  patch-stipulation: |
    Within a version of a browser, we only support the most recent patch release.
