      During the course of the survey, Ember 2.12 became the latest stable
      release of the framework. The 2.x release cycle began in August
      2015, and although 14% of developers still maintain a 1.13 app the
      largest segment of developers work with the last one or two
      Ember releases.

    <p class="text-md">
      Ember's Long-Term Support releases have emerged as a visible trend, and 21% of participants use the
      2.8-LTS release (the most recent during the survey).

      We asked respondents how likely they were to recommend Ember to a friend or colleague.
      An average recommendation score is 8.4, and the calculated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter">Net Promoter Score</a> is 42.
      The majority of responses were a perfect 10.

    <p class="text-md">
      Using the recommendation scores we created three segments of Detractors (1-6), Passives (7-8), and Promoters (9-10).
      Participants reported their reasoning for their score as free-form text,

        <h4>Score: 9</h4>
        <aside class="quote">
          I've worked with Ember professionally now for over 3 years, and select employment opportunities around whether or not I can continue working with it. While the community is smaller, the seamlessness of all the tooling and
          the overall developer experience is simply the best the open source community has to offer. My out of the box productivity on a new project and onboarding experience to new projects reaffirms so many decisions I didn't have to make.

        <h4>Score: 2</h4>
        <aside class="quote">
          I haven't found a scale of project for which Ember is suitable. The sheer amount of files and project complexity makes it impractical for small projects, and Ember Data doesn't scale for large projects. Documentation is
          often incomplete, types are often not specified, everything is mutable and unpredictable.

      <EsCard class="text-center my-2">
        <h4>Better Documentation, Examples and Guides</h4>
        <aside class="quote">
          Documentation is getting better, but I would love to see more detailed documentation of framework methods and properties and an easier way to know what the core team is currently working or focusing on... I would also love
          to understand more about broccoli, which continues to be a confusing part of the cli that I don't quite understand how to extend.

        <h4>Ember Data</h4>
        <aside class="quote">
          I'd like to see more stability/maturity from Ember Data. We've been able to get our API/back-end team to (sometimes reluctantly) adhere to JSON-API, but there are some features that we'd like a more complete answer for:
          multiple record updates/creates in one transaction, optimistic concurrency control (using ETag headers), and relationship updating/rollback on errors.

      <EsCard class="text-center my-2">
        <h4>Tree shaking</h4>
        <aside class="quote">
          In general I think that reducing the size and boot-up time of the application hasn't gotten enough attention. Tree-shaking and lazy code evaluation are important features to have these days, especially for larger
          applications. Also, bundling everything in one minified file maybe doesn't make as much sense anymore in an HTTP2 age.

      We were curious how important these topics were to participants with different
      amounts of experience. The following chart shows how experienced with Ember developers
      mentioning each topic are:

      Performance was a common theme regardless of experience with Ember.
      Documentation and guide improvement requests were more common from developers with less Ember experience
      while requests for tree shaking, routable components and mobile support were more prevalent among experienced Ember developers.

      Employers are choosing Ember despite challenges in finding experienced Ember developers in the job market. Among
      survey participants, 66% of developers who learned Ember this year did not know Ember when they were hired to their current job,
      and 49% of developers who learned Ember this year were hired by a company that adopted Ember after they were hired.
      Companies clearly believe in the benefits that Ember can bring their business and are willing to invest in training their developers.
