  <h2>Non-Legalese TL;DR</h2>

  <p>
    Ember's strong brand and identity are an important part of the project. We're protective of it! Please be respectful and <a href="mailto:leah@emberjs.com">reach out</a> if you're unsure if your use is acceptable. Visit the {{link-to 'branding page' 'logos'}} to learn more about what is and isn't permitted, and to download logos.
  </p>
  <p>
    We often grant licenses for use of the Ember logo for non-commercial community use cases. If you think you might be one of them, let's talk. We always aim to be reasonable.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Tomster in particular has many more restrictions and should not be used without express authorization. {{link-to 'You can view the various official Tomsters' 'tomster'}}, and check out {{link-to 'our growing FAQ' 'tomster.faq'}}.
