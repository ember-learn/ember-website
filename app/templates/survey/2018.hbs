    A project to learn who is using Ember and how.

      During the course of the survey, Ember 3.0 became the latest stable release of the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the feature removals in 3.0, over a quarter of survey participants are using the newest release. Ember 1.13 usage continues to drop slowly, and this year only 8% of developers report working with a 1.13 app and 5% using a pre-1.13 version.

  <:body>
    <p>
      Ember Data adoption follows a similar curve to Ember, with the majority of respondents on 3.0 or 2.18.
    </p>
    <p>
      Older Ember Data usage also continues to drop, with respondents on 1.13 at 7% (down from 10% last year) and on pre-1.13 at 4% (down from 7% last year).

      We asked respondents how likely they were to recommend Ember to a friend or colleague. An average recommendation score is 8.2, and the calculated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Net Promoter Score</a> is 35.4. The plurality of responses were a 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the recommendation scores we created three segments of Detractors (1-6), Passives (7-8), and Promoters (9-10). Participants reported their reasoning for their score as free-form text, and below we've provided the most frequent category of responses in each segment based on similarity analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a flavor of what reasons participants gave for their scoring:

There is typically a "suggested" way to do something, if not a documented best practice and almost any external library I've ever had to use was easily decomposable into native Ember components.

      As the last question of the survey we asked participants:
      "What would it take for you to feel great about using and recommending Ember for new projects?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Using text similarity analysis, we identified the most commonly mentioned topics. Here they are, in descending order.

          I like the way it seems like the framework is headed in the sense that it is being "destructured" into different optional pieces. I think that will be great for adoption.
          <br><br>
          Our biggest pain points have been around Ember Data (long-unaddressed issues, missing features like relationship dirty tracking, performance) so some addressing of those would also be nice.
          <br><br>
          Overall though I already feel great about using it and recommending it. I've used it for a couple personal projects already and would love to in the future.

          If Ember were easier to learn, and easier to work around the framework, perhaps less verbose I would feel great about using and recommending it more. I love the thinking that drives Ember, it is clear and predictable (similar to Rails).

          That being said, the documentation was difficult to get through and it was hard to maintain the philosophical clarity down into the details of the code.

          Simplification of the mental model for Ember.
          <br><br>
          After spending the last few months with React for the first time, I see the initial appeal—it's a vastly simply mental model. I realize that this is not entirely fair—React would be better compared to Glimmer than all of Ember.
          <br><br>
          For a sufficiently complex app, I have no doubt that an Ember implementation would be much easier to learn &amp; maintain. But for new or simple apps, there's overhead that is intimidating to newcomers and irksome to veterans such as myself. Even if we only compare React to Ember's view/component layer, React is still much simpler to learn and reason about.
          <br><br>
          And like it or not, the rest of the JS world compares React directly to Ember, and it feels futile to attempt to change that comparison. We need to do better in that comparison, not try to change everyone's mind that it's the wrong comparison to make.

          I think we need more new features. Glimmer components and some of the other major new usability enhancements that've been on the roadmap for some time would be really huge in selling Ember to the wider community.
          <br><br>
          We still have that
          reputation of being the same framework we were 4 years ago ... and I think it's undeserved. We are technically making strides past many other frameworks at this point, and I think showing what Ember is now capable of will finally break that mentality.

          Perhaps more critically, the whole framework seems to be balanced on the shoulders of just a few people, and I'd like to see that number grow. The "bus factor" risk appears to be pretty bad for the core libraries.

      The percentage of the community maintaining these now 3+ year old apps has declined every year but a significant number of respondents still do work on these apps, indicating that some Ember codebases can really stand the test of time.

      Each year we capture demographic information in addition to details about how the community interacts with the Ember project. The summary of locations participants call home remains mostly unchanged this year.

    <p>
      The percentage of women participants this year was 4%, roughly the same as last year. Improving the diversity of our community is important to many of us. Programs in the community like <a href="http://emberwomen.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Women Helping Women</a> make a difference.
