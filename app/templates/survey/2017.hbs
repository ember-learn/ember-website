      During the course of the survey, Ember 2.12 became the latest stable release of the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 2.x release cycle began in August 2015, and although 14% of developers still maintain a 1.13 app the largest segment of developers work with the last one or two Ember releases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ember's Long-Term Support releases have emerged as a visible trend, and 21% of participants use the 2.8-LTS release (the most recent during the survey).

      We asked respondents how likely they were to recommend Ember to a friend or colleague. An average recommendation score is 8.4, and the calculated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Net Promoter Score</a> is 42. The majority of responses were a perfect 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the recommendation scores we created three segments of Detractors (1-6), Passives (7-8), and Promoters (9-10). Participants reported their reasoning for their score as free-form text, and below we've provided the most frequent category of responses in each segment based on similarity analysis.

          While the community is smaller, the seamlessness of all the tooling and the overall developer experience is simply the best the open source community has to offer.

          I'd like to see more stability/maturity from Ember Data. We've been able to get our API/back-end team to (sometimes reluctantly) adhere to JSON-API, but there are some features that we'd like a more complete answer for: multiple record updates/creates in one transaction, optimistic concurrency control (using ETag headers), and relationship updating/rollback on errors.

          In general, I think that reducing the size and boot-up time of the application hasn't gotten enough attention. Tree-shaking and lazy code evaluation are important features to have these days, especially for larger applications. Also, bundling everything in one minified file maybe doesn't make as much sense anymore in an HTTP2 age.

      Employers are choosing Ember despite challenges in finding experienced Ember developers in the job market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among survey participants, 66% of developers who learned Ember this year did not know Ember when they were hired to their current job, and 49% of developers who learned Ember this year were hired by a company that adopted Ember after they were hired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Companies clearly believe in the benefits that Ember can bring their business and are willing to invest in training their developers.

      Ember developers continue to most commonly work on product with a small team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their roles are becoming more focused on the framework over time. In another question, participants reported 45% of them now work with Ember "all the time." This number is up from 32% in 2016.

      Most developers work on an Ember application that targets hundreds or thousands of users.
    </p>
    <p>
      In responses to another question in the survey, we noted that more developers work on B2B or B2C apps than internal tools compared to last year.

      Nearly one-third of Ember developers work with an app that is more than two years old. One out of five Ember developers is working with an app create in the last three months.

      Ruby retains the top spot in desired and actual server-side languages, however it also dropped 4% as a production platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only notable mover further down the list is Java, which jumped almost 4% in popularity over the past year.

      Atom moved up a spot to become the editor of choice primarily due to a drop in Sublime share. Interestingly, VS Code saw a 13% surge over the past year.

    <p>
      Developers need to support browsers before IE 11 less than ever before. As Ember 3.0 only supports IE 11 and up, most developers now have a browser support requirement un-related to specific browser versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next year we're going to look for a new way to ask this question that captures Chrome-only sites, the UCBrowser, and other data points we feel are missing.
