<h2>Ember.js Release Cycle</h2>

{{release-timeline project=emberBetaProject}}

<p>
  Ember releases follow a "train" release model. About every
  six weeks, the <code>master</code> branch of Ember (sometimes referred to as
  "canary") branches to become the new beta. After six weeks as a beta, this
  version becomes the new stable release of Ember.
</p>
<p>
  A release of a new Ember version is only considered complete when a
  <a href="https://emberjs.com/blog/tags/releases.html">
    release blog post
  </a>
  is published. Since multiple libraries make up a release,
  including `ember.js`, `ember-data`, `ember-cli`, and documentation,
  the release occurs in steps throughout a week-long window.
  Developers are encouraged to monitor the release blog posts for
  the official announcement before upgrading their apps.
  Release dates may shift as needed, but developers can expect roughly
  eight minor releases per year.
</p>

<p>
  LTS (Long Term Support) releases are done at least every four minor versions,
  plus the last version before a new major release. An LTS release receives security
  updates for 9 release cycles (54 weeks) and bugfixes for 5 release cycles
  (30 weeks).

<p>
  The Ember project adheres to
  <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. Releases are named
  according to a <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code> scheme, and only
  <code>MAJOR</code> versions releases may change or remove public APIs after
  deprecation. <code>MINOR</code> versions may introduce new features so long
  as they are backwards compatible, and <code>PATCH</code> releases may include
  bug or security fixes.

        Beta builds incorporate new features that are ready for evaluation in
        application code. We do not recommend using Beta builds in production.

        Release builds have been hardened through our multi-tiered release
        process. These builds are perfect for use in production environments.

      </p>
      <p>
        The LTS channel provides a longer support timeframe but receives
        new features less frequently. These builds are right for users who
        prefer to upgrade roughly twice a year.

  Periodically, various APIs in Ember may be deprecated. As new releases
  of Ember and Ember Data land, be sure to review the
  <a href="/deprecations">deprecation guides</a> and
  <a href="http://guides.emberjs.com">documentation guides</a>. These are updated
  regularly.
