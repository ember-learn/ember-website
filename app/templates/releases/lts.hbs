  <h2>What is an LTS release?</h2>

  <p>
    LTS versions receive bugfixes for 30 weeks and security updates for 54 weeks.
    An LTS release is the best version to use if you won't be updating your app frequently,
    but want to help your app stay secure and working smoothly.
    Another reason to use an LTS is if you have a very large, complex app,
    since LTS versions get even more testing and scrutiny than usual.
  </p>
  <p>
    An LTS is declared roughly every four minor versions, plus the final version before a
    major release. Before a version can be called an "LTS" release, it has to spend
    at least 6 weeks as a stable release, where it is used and tested by thousands of
    developers.
