      During the course of the survey, Ember 3.0 became the latest stable
      release of the framework. Despite the feature removals in 3.0, over a
      quarter of survey participants are using the newest release. Ember 1.13
      usage continues to drop slowly, and this year only 8% of developers
      report working with a 1.13 app and 5% using a pre-1.13 version.

      Ember Data adoption follows a similar curve to Ember, with the majority of respondents on 3.0 or 2.18. Older Ember Data usage also continues to drop, with respondents on 1.13 at 7% (down from 10% last year) and on pre-1.13 at 4% (down from
      7% last year).

          Ember has been a great experience for me over the last few years. The documentation is very mature, great examples in the wild, mature addon ecosystem, helpful community, etc. Convention over configuration is really great
          too. I've been able to jump to different organizations and teams within those organizations, and be able to quickly contribute to projects.

          I've used Ember for almost 5 years now and the development experience is as good as anything I've ever used. It allows me to build powerful user experiences with minimal concern about the underlying functionality of the
          FE. There is typically a "suggested" way to do something, if not a documented best practice and almost any external library I've ever had to use was easily decomposable into native Ember components.

        <h4>Ember Data</h4>
        <aside class="quote">
          I like the way it seems like the framework is headed in the sense that it is being “destructured” into different optional pieces. I think that will be great for adoption. Our biggest pain points have been around Ember Data (long-unaddressed
          issues, missing features like relationship dirty tracking, performance) so some addressing of those would also be nice. Overall though I already feel great about using it and recommending it. I’ve used it for a couple personal projects
          already and would love to in the future.

      <EsCard class="text-center my-2">
        <h4>Documentation</h4>
        <aside class="quote">
          If Ember were easier to learn, and easier to work around the framework, perhaps less verbose I would feel great about using and recommending it more.
          I love the thinking that drives Ember, it is clear and predictable (similar to Rails).
          That being said, the documentation was difficult to get through and it was hard to maintain the philosophical clarity down into the details of the code.

        <aside class="quote">
          Simplification of the mental model for Ember.

          After spending the last few months with React for the first time, I see the initial appeal - it's a vastly simply mental model. I realize that this is not entirely fair - React would be better compared to Glimmer than all of Ember.

          For a sufficiently complex app, I have no doubt that an Ember implementation would be much easier to learn &amp; maintain.

          But for new or simple apps, there's overhead that is intimidating to newcomers and irksome to veterans such as myself.

          Even if we only compare React to Ember's view/component layer, React is still much simpler to learn and reason about.

          And like it or not, the rest of the JS world compares React directly to Ember, and it feels futile to attempt to change that comparison. We need to do better in that comparison, not try to change everyone's mind that it's the wrong
          comparison to make.

      <EsCard class="text-center my-2">
        <h4>Glimmer</h4>
        <aside class="quote">
          I think we need more new features. Glimmer components and some of the other major new usability enhancements that've been on the roadmap for some time would be really huge in selling Ember to the wider community. We still have that
          reputation of being the same framework we were 4 years ago ... and I think it's undeserved. We are technically making strides past many other frameworks at this point, and I think showing what Ember is now capable of will finally break that
          mentality.

        <h4>Community</h4>

          Showing leadership in adopting new web standards and tech (e.g. WebAssembly). Keep pushing performance (Glimmer). Maintain Ember's identity. Continue to foster a great community.
        </aside>

        <br>

        <aside class="quote">
          I wish the leadership was more vocal to the broader JS community. We're doing amazing things and too many devs don't even know what Ember is. Perhaps more critically, the whole framework seems to be balanced on the shoulders of just a few
          people, and I'd like to see that number grow. The "bus factor" risk appears to be pretty bad for the core libraries.
