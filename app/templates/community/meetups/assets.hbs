        Custom Tomsters and Zoeys

      <p>
        You may have noticed that some user groups (Salt Lake City, Munich, London, etc.) have their own custom Tomster and Zoey variants. These have been commissioned and licensed by the groups. They paid a small commission fee to have the character designed by one of the official designers, and we granted them a license to use that variant for non-commercial user group related purposes.

        Thankfully, our designers love Ember and therefore give us ridiculously fair deals. Pricing ranges from $80 to $300, depending on the extent of the request. On average, most user groups spend $200.

      Recording Your Meetup
    </h2>

    <p>
      Many Ember Meetup organizers have done the community a tremendous service by having their meetups recorded. In some cases, groups are able to find sponsors, and in others, sponsors pick up either the expense and/or the labor.
    </p>

    <p>
      The London group was the first to roll their own, with Portland and other cities to follow. Overall, one-time equipment cost in USD was approximately $350, plus two HDMI cords and the use of an iPhone or Tablet.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're interested in recording your meetups on your own, here are the items some of those groups have had success with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KP473Q/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lightweight tripod</a> with adjustable-height legs, rubber feet and great maneuverability
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009GHYLKS/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Phone-sized mount</a> so your phone can hook into the tripod
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MIQ40JQ/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Game capture device</a> for recording the presenter's slides
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QKBVYK/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Voice recorder</a> so you're recording the speaker's audio separately, and not using the not-too-great cell phone video audio
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KMILKGS/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lavalier mic</a> that plugs into the voice recorder, to allow your speakers maximum maneuverability
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To make this setup work, you'll need a laptop, in addition to the presenter's laptop. The basic process is:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        The presenter's laptop gets plugged via HDMI into the Video Capture device (HDMI In).
      </li>
      <li>
        The video capture device gets plugged via HDMI into the projector (HDMI Out).
      </li>
      <li>
        The video capture device <em>also</em> plugs into the extra laptop via USB.
      </li>
      <li>
        The presenter wears the Voice Recording device in a pocket, with the Lavalier mic plugged in and attached somewhere near their neck. This will record your separate, clear audio stream.
      </li>
      <li>
        The tripod is positioned somewhere with a good view of the speaker, with the phone-specific-attachment screwed in, and then the phone inserted horizontally.
      </li>
      <li>
        When everything's ready to go, hit the record button on the capturing laptop, hit the record button on the iPhone, hit the record button on the voice recorder, and you're off to the races.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the event, download all three files onto one laptop, and use something like Screenflow to sync them up and produce your video. Alternatively, if you have <em>some</em> sponsorship, you can find a local producer or videographer to do this work for you for a few hundred dollars, depending on the volume of content.
      </li>
    </ol>
