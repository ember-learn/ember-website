  <p>
    Editions are a concept that were introduced to Ember with <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0364-roadmap-2018.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC #364 - Ember 2018 Roadmap</a>. An edition represents a cohesive programming model, and releasing a new edition represents a shift in the programming model due to new features and concepts being added to Ember. Ember Octane is the first new edition that was added to Ember.
  </p>
  <p>
    Editions give us an opportunity to bring our documentation and marketing up-to-date to reflect the improvements
  weâ€™ve made since the previous edition. They are also the time to synchronize Ember and the wider ecosystem,
  including updating default settings, blueprints, addons, and more.
  Editions also help ensure that Ember users are getting a cohesive, polished experience.
  </p>
  <p>So, when is the right time to declare a new edition?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A significant, coherent set of new features and APIs have all landed in the stable channel.</li>
    <li>Error messages and the developer ergonomics of those new features have been fully polished.</li>
    <li>Tooling (the Ember Inspector, blueprints, codemods, etc.) has been updated to work with these new features.</li>
    <li>API documentation, guides, tutorials, and example code has been updated to incorporate the new features.</li>
  </ul>
