    <dt>I'm starting a new app at work. Should I use Octane?</dt>
    <dd>
      Octane is in <em>preview</em> mode- there are bound to be rough edges, and upcoming changes. Since we don't know <i>what</i> we don't know just yet, we advise that Octane be used for experimentation only. We recommend that you continue to use stable versions of Ember for new production applications.
