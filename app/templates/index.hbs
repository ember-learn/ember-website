        <p>Ember CLI is the backbone of modern Ember apps, providing code generators to create new entities and putting the necessary files in the right place, every time. Ember apps come with a <strong>built-in development environment</strong> with fast rebuilds, auto-reload, and a test runner! <br><br> Ready to deploy? That's easy, too— build your app for production with a single command.</p>

      <div class="lg:col-2">
        <h3 class="text-lg">Routing</h3>
        <p>The URL has always been one of the major strengths of the web, and Ember apps respect that. Ember's built-in router is a <strong>best-in-class solution</strong> that incorporates async data loading with dynamic url segments and query parameters. The Ember router seamlessly supports nested urls with incremental data fetching, nested loading, and error substates.</p>

        <h3 class="text-lg">Data layer</h3>
        <p>
          While you can use any data layer for your app, every new Ember app includes a fully-featured data access library called Ember Data. <br><br>Ember Data allows you to access data across multiple sources at once, setup asynchronous relationships, and keep models up-to-date across your app.

        <h3 class="text-lg">Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Enjoy a fully-featured, modern test harness built into every application by default. Every time an entity is generated in an Ember app, tests are also generated for that same entity. Ember apps support three levels of testing that are handy for testing everything from individual components to acceptance tests that can boot your whole app and interact with it to verify everything is working as it should be. <br><br>Tests are also run in the browser, providing that extra peace of mind.

          Ember follows a 6-week release cycle, releasing a new minor version every 6 weeks. With a <strong>strong commitment to stability</strong>, upgrades between minor versions are straightforward and fast. The well-thought-out deprecation mechanism that gives you ample warning of code that would need to change in the next major version, and deprecated or upgraded features often come with codemods that can be run to automatically update your codebase. <br><br>If you do happen to get stuck, our friendly community is ready and willing to help!
