      Despite running the survey for a shorter period of time than in previous years, we had a similar number of responses as last year.
      We think that this speaks both to the level of investment in the Ember community, and to the outreach methods used to ensure that all community members are given an opportunity to let us know what they think.
      With over 1200 responses, here are the 2019 survey results!

      We asked respondents how likely they were to recommend Ember to a friend or colleague.
      The mean recommendation score is 8, and the calculated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter">Net Promoter Score</a> is 27.6.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants reported their reasoning for their score as free-form text,
      and below, we've provided a sample of responses alongside their corresponding recommendation score.
    </p>
    <p>
      We did not observe a great deal of variety in the written responses that corresponded to values of five or less.
      However, we were thrilled to see the opposite effect in the upper ranges -- that is, <b>community members simply have a lot of different reasons to recommend Ember</b> to a friend or colleague!

      Here is a flavor of what reasons participants gave for their scoring:

      During the course of the survey, Ember 3.8 became the latest stable release of the framework. 28% of developers reported working with Ember 3.7, and 12.5% reported working with 3.8 (only released a few weeks ago). Some legacy 2.x versions of Ember rose in usage as a percentage of participants, but the 1.13 number dropped indicating a continued upgrade process for developers on legacy versions of Ember.

      Accessibility has very clearly been self-identified as "the final frontier" for Ember developers!
      Our community has proven over time that shared solutions work well, and this area is a great opportunity to provide accessible applications to <em>everyone</em> who uses an Ember app- which, these days, includes websites to pay your utilities, do your banking, and more!

The data suggests that the Ember community is not well-represented in other surveys. We believe this is due to specific outreach methods we use to ensure a wide-range of participation. We think that this data could be useful to other tech survey writers, and we will attempt to share our outreach methods, in order to help them obtain a more accurate sampling of the Ember community at large.

I also think it's great that the Core team has recognized that marketing the framework is important and taken initiatives around redesigning the emberjs.com and doing larger named releases like Octane. I think the more interest and differing opinions that are brought in, the stronger we'll be as a community."
