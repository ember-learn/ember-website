      During the course of the survey, Ember 3.0 became the latest stable
      release of the framework. Despite the feature removals in 3.0, over a
      quarter of survey participants are using the newest release. Ember 1.13
      usage continues to drop slowly, and this year only 8% of developers
      report working with a 1.13 app and 5% using a pre-1.13 version.

      Ember Data adoption follows a similar curve to Ember, with the majority of respondents on 3.0 or 2.18. Older Ember Data usage also continues to drop, with respondents on 1.13 at 7% (down from 10% last year) and on pre-1.13 at 4% (down from
      7% last year).

      We asked respondents how likely they were to recommend Ember to a friend or colleague.
      An average recommendation score is 8.2, and the calculated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter">Net Promoter Score</a> is 35.4.
      The plurality of responses were a 10.

    <p class="large">
      Using the recommendation scores we created three segments of Detractors (1-6), Passives (7-8), and Promoters (9-10).
      Participants reported their reasoning for their score as free-form text,

      each segment based on similarity analysis.

      and Java increased from 3rd-most popular last year (21%) to 2nd most popular this year, with 26% usage.

      Developers need to support browsers before IE11 less than ever before.

      Next year we're going to look for a new way to ask this question that
      captures Chrome-only sites, the UCBrowser, and other data points we
      feel are missing.
