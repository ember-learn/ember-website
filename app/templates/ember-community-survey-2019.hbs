      During the course of the survey, Ember 3.0 became the latest stable
      release of the framework. Despite the feature removals in 3.0,
      <strong>
        over a quarter of survey participants are using the newest release.
      </strong>
      Ember 1.13 usage continues to drop slowly, and this year only 8% of developers
      report working with a 1.13 app and 5% using a pre-1.13 version.

      Ember Data adoption follows a similar curve to Ember, <strong>with the majority of respondents on 3.0 or 2.18.</strong> Older Ember Data usage also continues to drop, with respondents on 1.13 at 7% (down from 10% last year) and on pre-1.13 at 4% (down from

      We asked respondents how likely they were to recommend Ember to a friend or colleague.
      An average recommendation score is 8.2, and the calculated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter">Net Promoter Score</a> is 35.4.
      The plurality of responses was a 10.

    <p class="large">
      Using the recommendation scores we created three segments of Detractors (1-6), Passives (7-8), and Promoters (9-10).
      Participants reported their reasoning for their score as free-form text,
      and below we've provided the most frequent category of responses in
      each segment based on similarity analysis.

      Developers need to support browsers before IE11 less than ever before.

      captures Chrome-only sites, the UCBrowser, and other data points we
