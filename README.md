Ember.js is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework for building modern web applications. It includes everything you need to build rich UIs that work on any device. It does so by providing developers many features that are essential to manage complexity in modern web applications, as well as an integrated development toolkit that enables rapid iteration. Ember has been around since 2011. It's also not the product it was in 2011, and has adapted/evolved into an experienced, dependable ecosystem. Ember components are everything you never knew you always wanted. It's not just about the components, it's about component isolation. There is a long running list of companies that make use of Ember.js like Netflix, Square, Bustle, TED, Microsoft, Linkedin and many more. 

Ember is an Open Source project that relies on the tireless support of individual contributors. These are the teams that guide the development and instruction of Ember.js.
