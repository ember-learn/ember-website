What ember's call 'routes' are actually 'view controllers' (and actions in routes being 'action controllers') in the traditional MVC paradigm. View controllers in MVC are responsible for gathering up the necessary view model in terms of the concepts in the model layer when a request matching with its URI template is received and then passing it into the necessary view. This is exactly what routes do but under a different new name.
What ember called 'controllers' was actually the logical parts of the view, which with templates constitutes 'views' in the traditional MVC paradigm. Traditionally views consist of a template and optional business logic that can work on the client side. That optional view logic is what ember used to call controllers.
So legacy naming MRVC was only unnecessarily confusing and was creating its concepts where there were already applicable ones existing. The recent pattern of Model-Route-Component maps with the traditional MVC in a better way; routes being C and components being V. 
Of course this in no way hurts the developer experience but in my opinion, increases the learning curve coming from traditional server-side MVC web frameworks.

Lastly, an object model that makes use of native javascript concepts, and a production-ready fastboot are the definitive features that could let me evangelize the ember on all fronts, everywhere. I think both of them holds tremendous value to all web developers around the world.",,,

I code javascript in a old 'old school' way: I include ember js files the same way you would do with jquery for example.

I am not willing to use ember CLI as I don't like to compile stuff everytime I make a small change. I have a simple workflow like this: 
- amend a js file
- save it
- upload it on FTP
- refresh the browser page and check if it's all good

I have a feeling that using ember CLI will make it more complex. It seems that I have no choice anymore with the new version 3: using ember was as easy as including 2 js files in the page: the min version and the template compiler. It won't be anymore, that's an unconfortable choice.

It would be awesome if you could reconsider the choice you made and bring back compiled versions of ember ready to download.

Once again, thank you so much for doing ember, it made possible projects like www.xr.plus
( the user area is using ember as the core of a 3D editor to make web Augmented Reality content)

Thank you!

- Import statements don't map to anything and my IDE has no idea where to look (import @ember/string)
- Brocolli build is very limiting and I can't do a fraction of what I could do with Gulp and Webpack. Maybe make an eject version where I could modify the build settings? If not, we need more docs + flexibility in the order of when the trees are compiled. 
- I miss hot module reloading. This is the most exciting new feature in modern web development and there doesn't appear to be a path to make this work in Ember.
- It's hard to make an ember app do more than it's advertised to do. Finding things that are outside the norm is incredibly challenging and I have to look into the actual source code to learn things
- Ember is incredibly hard to learn, but it smoothes out at some point. I feel I have to memorize my entire app to be efficient. 

I will say this, it's a large framework and maybe these are just symptoms of that, but compared to projects like Vue - I felt like I went back a few years when starting a project on Ember. If the issues are addressed above, this would have potential to be my favorite framework because I love the concept of addons and the opinionated structure of everything.",,,

,2,"It functions, but I've used Vue, Angular 1, Ember and React, and Ember doesn't really have much that stands out.

Builds are very slow with Ember, the API has some odd missing pieces (where's the object/Map equivalent of computed('x.[]')?), the ramp up time is quite high compared to competing frameworks.

The heavy push towards JSON API doesn't help unless both UI and API are greenfield projects. Otherwise, Ember Data feels like a heavy layer for not much benefit. While you could use just window.fetch() in that case, too much of the Ember ecosystem assumes Ember Data to use that.

The Ember Inspector feels clunky compared to the Vue devtools, at least in Firefox. Let's say I want to inspect the value of myController.items[0].name -> 

I need to either:

1. Navigate to myController in the inspector
2. Send items to $E.
3. Run $E.objectAt(0].get('name')

or if items happens to be managed in Ember Data

1. Find the item type in the Ember Data list (potentially quite large
2. Manually scroll through all items to find the instance I want.

Initiative such as pods or angle components which were promoted as the future then unceremoniously cancelled or dropped.

The strict naming convention requiring so many identical names renders my jump to file feature in my editor less useful. Is foobar.js the model for foobars, the route for the foobar display page, the controller for the same, etc.

But for a start:

Pods. Opening my models folder makes my editor lag. Resurrect these or bring an alternative to stuffing 10s or 100s of files in a folder.
Use ES6 properties instead of .get()/.set() everywhere. I understand there are steps in place for this, please don't let it end up like the initial version of pods/angle components where they got forgotten for the next shiny.

The only logical course of action for an Ember developer therefore is to get a job at one of these (mostly american) companies or use something else.

Ember has and continues to make a tremendous contribution to innovation in the js framework space. But it's time to consider a merge a la merb and rails instead of further framework proliferation a la Glimmer.

P.S. If you want to market the framework better, write more articles about the server-side integrations (how to set up example projects on both server and client), to align ember with more existing large coder communities (java spring boot, php symfony, drupal,  wordpress, magento, node etc.) on your official site, e.g. in Cookbook format.

1. But I think for Ember to thrive long-term contributions should go up. I know LinkedIn is using it, perhaps you could work on driving more usage in Microsoft after they purchased LinkedIn? 

Typescript is already popular with Ember people, and Microsoft doesn't 'have' a framework (Google has Angular, Facebook has react). 

2. Ember has always been about 'ambitious apps', perhaps you could extend the website with 1-2 pages explaining how Ember is a great with for large companies, do a case study with LinkedIn and Intercom for example.

Aside: I was happy with this survey until the ""what is your current gender identity"" question. It's ironic that the people who don't want gender to matter (which is an idea that I support!) are the ones that are most obsessed about gender. 

Why not leave gender politics out of a code-related survey and focus on the technology instead?",,,

However, I have worked on client projects in the past where the client adopted Ember on my recommendation, and later had significant trouble maintaining the project and hiring developers with enough Ember expertise to maintain the project. I think this probably is more of a hiring and training and business problem than any inherent issue with Ember, but I see choice of tech as a business decision, and although I love the community, the ecosystem, the developer ergonomics, it is becoming harder for me to recommend it in certain scenarios, particular when there is a large business trying to migrate its legacy application to a modern stack (and ramp up legacy developers tbh). A lot of it I think has to do with ramping up developers who find Ember to be a bit overwhelming to wrap their arms around or who disagree with or don't understand some aspect of Ember's conventions and then throw their arms up at the whole thing.

Compared to developers who are familiar with React, Ember.js developers are just not as plentiful, so I think their concerns are valid. I wish there were a way of increasing the pool of developers who are using Ember.js. One thing that has me turning more and more towards Vue.js is how low the barrier to entry is. Even if it means I'm handing off a project to junior developers who don't fully understand JavaScript.

The slack community (where I ask questions when I cannot find the solution via the API/Guides) arn't very keen on answering questions about ember that is that old as well. Our ember did not use the CLI. Due to the amount of breaking changes, we decided it would be a easier to just rewrite the application in the latest version (3.0.0).

Although the materials for upgrading ember are available through various blog update posts and shifting through very old stack overflow and blog posts, there isn't a clear upgrade process for versions that old. Majority of the API docs also give a 404 which doesn't help.

After spending the last few months with React for the first time, I see the initial appeal - it's a vastly simply mental model. I realize that this is not entirely fair - React would be better compared to Glimmer than all of Ember.

For a sufficiently complex app, I have no doubt that an Ember implementation would be much easier to learn & maintain.

But for new or simple apps, there's overhead that is intimidating to newcomers and irksome to veterans such as myself.

Even if we only compare React to Ember's view/component layer, React is still much simpler to learn and reason about.

However, I do notice that there seems to be a lot of people around (on the internet and such) who seem to try to overlook Ember as a framework.  They mention Angular, React and Vue (etc) as the most relevant frameworks and almost seem to try to ignore Ember.  I think this largely comes down to the fact that some people resent the opinionated nature of Ember.  I personally find that to be a good thing about Ember.  So often when I have worked with React or Angular, I feel like there are many things that just aren't there in those frameworks that are present in Ember.  The learning curve for new users to Ember is pretty high I think.  I have known a number of devs that have felt that way.  However, documentation has been improving and changes have been stabilizing since the 2.0 release so those should be less prevalent problems at this point.  In my opinion, there is just so much that Ember has.  If you take just the addon eco system.  What other framework has that advanced of an eco system for community code?  None that I have found.  It's a great framework and I look forward to using it for years to come.  Hopefully it can break through the barriers of opinion and become a more widely accepted powerhouse in the market.",,,

This can happen in one of two ways: 1. Make Ember-data be much easier to customize, mostly at the response structure level. What I mean is that the current implementation almost forces you to follow the json-api spec, whereas most of my server side code (which has been running for a while) does not. One might say the easiest way is to rewrite the server side responses to adhere to the json-api spec, but since I am using Spring Boot and there is no ""easy"" way to do things, and there are multiple platforms (iOS, Android and third party services) hooked into them, I do not believe I should change code that is fully tested and working just to be able to use ember. Although the convention over configuration mantra works quite well, it is too stubborn for some situations.  2. Create libraries for most server side frameworks that allow you to convert the responses in an easy way. Although this is not strictly the job of the Ember team, it is ember-data that forces you to use such a spec.",,,

Learning how to do things the right way is harder than it should be.
Debugging test failures or in app errors where all you see is a vague message with a stack trace makes development harder than it should be.

Continue to improve performance. Ember will continue to be compared to other frameworks performance. While I think Ember's performance is good enough, developers will use performance as a reference to use something else.

2. Making importing node modules automatic. Importing node modules should be as simple as adding a package as a dependency (or devDependency) in package.json - on this note, document via blog why dependencies need to be defined as a devDependency instead of a dependency. Importing dependencies has too many steps that I think would easily deter people.

3. Ember-cli speed improvements. Complex applications are likely to have many addons which slows down ember-cli build times.

,8,"Ember is a fantastic framework for getting everyone on board and up to speed with a set of standards. It currently sits a little behind in terms of interactivity with the larger JS ecosystem ( lazy loaded modules, tree shaking, standard imports ) that make it a little harder to use to do more advanced deployments.

Aside from those specific concerns the documentation is A plus and the ember-cli add-on system is second to none at the moment.

For the first few years, Ember was on the bleeding edge, providing a fully featured framework that brought sanity to frontend development and overcame a lot of the limitations with Javascript and browser quirks.  It was genuinely pushing the web forward (classes and mixins, computed properties, promises, ES6, JSON:API), and it did a remarkable job with that.  And as other frameworks and tools appeared, in my opinion Ember was still the Holy Grail because it offered an opinionated holistic framework and offered ""stability without stagnation"".  The learning curve was steeper than competitive tools, but it was well worth it.

Fast forward to today, Ember may have pushed the web forward, but it feels like it is being left behind.  With a more mature Javascript language, evergreen browsers, transpilers letting you write modern Javascript without worrying about older browsers, async/await, and Typescript, Ember feels quite outdated at the moment.  Progress has felt very slow... or dare I say ""stagnant"".  I know there has been a lot of work with Glimmer 2 and module unification, but it feels like there has been little improvement in the way that Ember apps are written.  The Javascript being written does not feel like modern Javascript, when there are other frameworks that let you take advantage of Javascript classes, Typescript, async/await right out of the box.  I used Glimmerjs for a project and was hopeful that it reflected the future of what building an Ember app would become, but discussion about integration into Ember has been quiet this past year.

While Ember's adoption has always been less than others, it seems like it is left out of the conversation these days.  It would take a lot to convince a business leader to choose Ember over other competitors due to its lack of adoption and lack of a talent pool.  And because it's not being adopted, there are much fewer sponsors to help fund ongoing improvement.

Ember Data is my biggest day-to-day pain point, and it has seen very little improvement for quite some time.  The Model Data RFC seems like it is the first step to addressing some long-standing issues, but it's unclear how long it will take to implement (we've been talking about module unification for two years).

The few things I believe is keeping Ember back these days are:

* Still needing to use the Ember object model for everything instead of Javascript classes.  I've seen some blog posts about experimenting with JS classes but it does not seem to be available out of the box.  As a developer, I want to be able to write modern canonical Javascript.  Even if it is being transpiled into the Ember object model as part of the build process, I think this will go a long way to making it feel more modern.

* Support for async/await out of the box.  Again it's unclear whether or not it is.  Nobody has mentioned that it works, any chatter about has been about testing.  I use ember-concurrency and it's much better than promises, but again, baking in async/await support would be a good step forward.  Again, even if it is being transpiled along the way, it doesn't matter.

* Improve Ember Data's data flow: immutability, forking / transactions, etc.

I genuinely appreciate the work everyone has put into it.  I dabble when I can, but I have very few free cycles these days between work and family.  I want to see Ember be talked about in the same breath as React and Vue, continue to evolve as other frameworks fall in and out of fashion, and maintain market share.  It doesn't have to be the most popular, but it really needs to be more popular that it is today.  Hopefully things will be moving more quickly now that 3.0 has landed.",,,

Currently, it seems almost be relegated to being mentioned alongside AngularJS, Knockout and even Backbone as one of the ""older"" frameworks. And I don't hear it mentioned alongside React, Angular or Vue as a framework to use going forward. This concerns me as I worry about maintainers moving on from the Ember ecosystem for one of the more recent frameworks, despite the strides being made by the Ember team. And the team IS doing really good things, but it does not seem to be picked up much by the larger JavaScript community. Making Ember more modular so that parts of Ember can be used without needing the entire ecosystem (the ""install your way to Ember"" that was heard in the 2017 EmberConf). Also, moving to a structure more like the component based structures of the other relevant JS frameworks (i.e. lose the MVC structure) would help.",,,

Forms are the difference between todo apps and ambitious apps, and while ember prides itself in less developer choices, there are 39 published ways to build forms for ember.  https://emberobserver.com/categories/forms 

Rallying behind a single way to build forms would allow developers to more easily publish ""complex input"" widgets along with their modules. 

Most of this opinion is driven by the Drupal FAPI. Yes yes, it's php. I can only speak for my own experiences. and I can tell you I started with Drupal because forms were easy. https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/developer%21topics%21forms_api_reference.html/7.x
https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/howtos/how-to-make-a-simple-module-with-a-form-and-menu-link

Secondly, contrib community governance. I spent 10 years or so doing Drupal work and there are many steps to ensure at somewhat rich contrib ecosystem. I know this is a greater issue in the javascript land, and not just ember, but I think if ember could figure it out it would be a big win.

The form thing is a great example, I think there should be more reasons to contribute to existing projects than reasons to make a new project trying to tackle the same problem. That concept I think flows well into ember's message, but when it comes the contrib ecosystem there are tons and tons of cases in which multiple modules compete for the same use case.

forms: 39 options
mapbox gl: 5 options
mapbox: 4 options
async buttons: 12 options (are there really that many ways to implement a single button pattern?)

I really appreciate ember observer... But I think there should be a contrib section on ember.js... with specific criteria to be listed as a recommended module of some kind. Filtering by version would also be great... I think trying to google ""how to build complex forms with ember"" and then finding the 39 options and half of them haven't been updated in forever is overwhelming for users.",,,

Easy code-splitting. Engines are an interesting approach and allow for very explicit code-splitting (including vendor files). The problem is that the implementation is not very stable (bugs with FastBoot) and its design is catered towards large apps with clear-cut boundaries. There are many cases where I don't need a large component/collection of contextual components to load instantly. I'm willing to make the tradeoff of speed for a smaller initial bundle size. The ability make a component `loadable` (react-loadable) or use a webpack-style async import can be extremely useful in these cases.
Open up the component APIs to let addon developers painlessly experiment, without the stigma of touching private API. A lot of the key template helpers that enable contextual components are also locked off, like `action` and `component`. Not everything can be expressed in templates. A bit of js can go a long way.",,,

Better documentation on broccoli could be nice.

I believe there's currently a high barrier to entry for new addon devs who want to create an addon, but aren't sure how some of these build hooks work. I understand you can't document all of the cases, but I think there's a balance that could be struck.

Code splitting to decrease /dist size sounds great too, and know that's in the pipeline.

For the first few years, Ember was on the bleeding edge, providing a fully featured framework that brought sanity to frontend development and overcame a lot of the limitations with Javascript and browser quirks.  It was genuinely pushing the web forward (classes and mixins, computed properties, promises, ES6), and it did a remarkable job with that.  And as other frameworks and tools appeared, in my opinion Ember was still the Holy Grail because it offered an opinionated holistic framework and offered ""stability without stagnation"".  The learning curve was steeper than competitive tools, but it was well worth it.

Fast forward to today, Ember may have pushed the web forward, but it feels like it is being left behind.  With a more mature Javascript language, evergreen browsers, transpilers letting you write modern Javascript without worrying about older browsers, async/await, and Typescript, Ember feels quite outdated at the moment.  Progress has felt very slow... or dare I say ""stagnant"".  I know there has been a lot of work with Glimmer 2 and module unification, but it feels like there has been little improvement in the way that Ember apps are written.  The Javascript being written does not feel like modern Javascript.

Its adoption seems much less than others these days, and it would take a lot to convince a business leader to choose Ember over other competitors due to its lack of adoption and lack of a talent pool.",,,

,1,"no built in hot reloading, no built in discrete state management (cough cough redux/cerebrum), `this` is used across the whole app, pseudo globally, but is always going to be something different depending on where you are. There are private properties you can access, but maybe shouldn't, but you never really know which ones are actually a-ok. It's object oriented, and is therefore far more complex than a functional language+framework. It's very hard to re-use code. Handlebars actually sucks, designers can't know what variables they can use, I don't know any ""designers"" that use handlebars, yet it seems to be targetted towards them. The audience seems to be ruby/rails type people that want to keep logic out of their templates, which is historically a respectable goal, but this goal is not even achieved. JSX is actually extremely usable and improving every day. There is support for compilation to incremental dom, which has the same architecture as glimmer. Oh, and the object model. .get('this') or/and set(this, 'crap'..). Idk if it's ever been beginner friendly, but it doesn't seem to be getting better.

The reality feels _much_ messier; more like a personality cult. The ember community tries very hard to get people involved and contributing, but it still feels like there are those that _know_...and everyone else. If you haven't been part of the discussion before its public, you're just going to be behind, and probably 'incorrect' with your opinions. I think embereños generally has a weird smugness and chip on its shoulder, for some reason. I do believe the leadership _is_ trying to make the best framework possible and demand more of the internet. Unfortunately, it seems like there's an over emphasis this (and a lot of self-congratulation for trying), and not as much focus on how to actually use it to build ambitious products.",,,

1) Ember Data, and it's role in the route lifecycle, seems to struggle with anything more than trivial applications.  The nature of modern crud apps is lots of relational data, and both retrieving and saving relational data is pretty tricky to do right.
2) Ember is heavy-weight.  The modules RFC is awesome here, and much needed.  Also, Ember Engines are difficult to use compared with Angular's simple config for lazy loading routes.  Lazy loading needs to be much simpler.
3) The lack of an ""Ember Native"" is killing us.  Cordova wrapped Ember does not cut it for those expecting a slick mobile experience.  Neither do PWAs.  Which leaves us looking at React Native, Xamarin, etc - all of which we do so really reluctantly due to the lack of Ember support.  I'd be so excited with Ember support in this area.",,,

Smaller bundle sizes, less execution blocking, tree-shaking, etc. Also, a smaller API would be nice. I think Glimmer components will help with this a lot, but when will they be feasible for production?

Which is another point: Ember must iterate faster. We're just now talking about tree-shaking, es6 classes, individual module imports, spreadable attributes, etc. where other frameworks have enjoyed these features for years. It feels like Ember is always playing catch-up rather than leading the field. If I'm a developer choosing a framework/library, I don't want the one that is perpetually just behind the curve. Don't get me wrong, Ember has lots of strengths, but it falls behind in key areas that are very important to developers.

It also seems that some features are left half-baked, like engines. Engines ""work"" but they don't have good developer ergonomics. For example, you can't use many editor plugins with engines, because they can't resolve the paths. Don't get me started on the Ember resolver. Why can't we just have relative imports that are easy to reason about and understand? Too much magic.

I'm not placing blame on the community or anyone for Ember's shortcomings, but when asked what it would take for me to recommend it over some of the other fantastic options available today the short answer is ""a  lot"". If I had to recommend a general approach to follow for improvements, it would be to move as close to web standards as possible. I think devs want to move away from esoteric frameworks and more towards vanilla js and web components. Glimmer components is a good first step, now we just need to execute on that quickly!",,,

Other things that Ember is working on, but still not 100% is ES classes and setters (we got getters!). Single file components would be very interesting and compelling for the folks coming from Vue and React, as they are used to not have multiple files per component.

Then I moved to a company that does software consulting for Embraer (the largest aircraft manufacturer in Latin America), when I entered the stack there was AngularJS and quickly saw how much the teams suffered with standards, where each project followed in a way. I have also implemented Ember and am still on the path to evangelize him here, adoption has been well received and we are reaping good fruit. I always had a lot of help when I needed it, especially in Ember's Slack. Much still remains to be done, for it is still difficult to find new content about Ember.

""Hello worlds"" are cool, but they are not practical to show new people what they can really take advantage of Ember.

There are many, many, but many problems in many places (Ember, Ember-Data, Ember-Cli) that were opened a long time ago, with users recently asking ""Any update on this?"" This is very frustrating. And I fully understand that it is a lot and sometimes people are lacking to take these issues and either resolve or respond to someone else. But it's still a problem.

Could have a place in Ember with Addons indicated by the main staff. The complements we know are essential to use on 90% of Ember's projects. This will also help (I think) that other users knowing the existence of these addons may help the addons themselves. Some addons: Ember-Simple-Auth, Ember-Cli-Mirage and some internationalization complement (I quote below).

It would be great if there was an internationalization session with Ember. Both via YAML and via EndPoints. Even if this is something made available by a third party add-on, which application does not have to be internationalized today? Many and many. If I was a new user of Ember and tried to choose between Ember, React and Angular and I had this information in Ember it would be much easier to choose.

I'd like to do more than I'm talking about here. Just talking is easy. Talk is cheap, show me the code haha. This year I will be working more with Ember fulltime and I hope to have some time to return to Ember what he has given me.

If you want to look for me to know more, I'm in Ember's slack as danilovaz :)",,,

,7,"It's a great framework, but there are several issues that knock it down a few notches. In the 2.x series, there have been many breaking changes between minor versions despite assurances to the contrary. Documentation could be better. And finally, it is difficult to build very large applications composed of many Ember engines and addons. One major issue is that of dependency management.

Oh yeah, and ember-engines has received almost no updates in forever, so we can't code-split our huge app. Even at that point, the rest of the js community is miles ahead of simple route-based code splitting. ember-cli has loads of catching up to do.

- Engines is a terrible solution for code-splitting. Code-splitting needs to not be route-based, and not use addons. The entire thing feels overarchitected, hard to set up, hard to understand, and for no gain over other solutions.
- ember-data is incredibly buggy and the code is impossible to understand. It's maintainers seem to have jumped ship (or they've chosen to ignore me, I'm not sure which is worse). 
- Tom Dale standing up at ReactiveConf and getting all smug about having bytecode templates (not even landed after all this time??) is depressing. Ember apps can't even code split, so I could have all the bytecode templates in the world and sites that use webpack would still load faster.
- Tom Dale being smug and calling himself a ""thoughtleader."" I mean come. on.

If you google ""Ember computed property"" right now, look at the results. They're horrible. An old API doc, and two outdated guides. 

Better yet, google ""Ember readonly"". There is only one emberjs hosted result in the first view results, and it is for Ember.View, and the link is broken. UGGGGGGGH.

I'm sure you take this issue seriously, but the docs have had horrible SEO since I started using Ember ~1.5 years ago. Vue, React, and Angular do not suffer from these issues. I don't think it is sufficient to tell someone to bookmark the URL of the Ember API docs.

People expect to be able to use Google to find docs. 
I know the team has a lot of priorities, but please dedicate time to this.

Even using the in-page search for something like ""currentRouteName"" doesn't work. That's a well defined property on the RouterService and your own internal search tool can't find it, and Google can't either. The search results for ""Ember currentRouteName"" are useless.

This is really frustrating to me, and I am having a really hard time convincing my employer that Ember was a good decision considering how difficult it is to find relevant documentation. I trudged through to learn Ember, but I am going to have an uphill battle convincing new devs to use it at my company, and our senior team is frowning at Ember considering the state of the docs.

Sorry, I know a lot of time goes into the docs, but this is a very real problem.

Does Google's webmaster tools complain? Can you add a sitemap? What does ""Fetch & Render"" as Googlebot show? Is it failing to render parts of the UI and so can't crawl the site? Can you canonical ALL docs to /release/ ?

Same issue applies not just for API docs. Try searching for ""ember component lifecycle"" or ""ember route lifecycle"". Irrelevant docs show up first and foremost.",,,
